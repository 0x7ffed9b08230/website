<h1 align="center">Website</h1>

This is my personal website. It is built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), a Vue.js framework. The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Development

To run the website locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Create a .env file with the following content
# GITHUB_USER=your_github_username
# GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
# RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_recaptcha_secret
# EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
# EMAIL_PASS=your_email_pass
# EMAIL_HOST=your_website_ip (e.g. 192.168.0.12)

# Run the website
$ sudo npm run dev # or open cmd as administrator and run npm run dev
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost`.
