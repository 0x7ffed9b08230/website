<h1 align="center">Website</h1>

This is my personal website. It is built using [AstroJS](https://astro.build), a Web framework. The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Development

To run the website locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

Edit the [`presentation.ts`](./src/data/presentation.ts) file to add your personal information. Then, run the following command:

```bash
# Start the development server

```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.
